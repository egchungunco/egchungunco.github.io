          <h2>Answers</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>1.</strong> First thing that paid attention to was the
            artwork of the seaplane in front of the sunset <br />
            <strong>2.</strong> The discrete actions that I did included
            reminiscing on the last time being on vacation at the beach. I also
            caught myself feeling calmer by the end of the experience in
            comparison to when I had just opened the webpage.<br />
            <strong>3.</strong> The feature that I spent the most time on in the
            experience was holding the image and letting the background music
            fade out to immerse myself in the scene <br />
            The most common feature was probably the dragging of the image as
            well as using the wheel at the bottom of the screen <br />
            <strong>4.</strong> The most common action that I did during the two
            minutes was the constant scrolling on the wheel at the bottom of the
            screen to see the next part of the story. <br />
            <strong>5.</strong> I think that the intended goal of the experience
            was for Richard Mille to immerse the user in what island hopping on
            vacation might be like as well as put them in different settings
            that are commonly associated witht he activity. <br />
            <strong>6.</strong> I think that it should be as much as the user
            wants. Each person would want to interact with it more or less times
            than someone else. Different brain conditions and trains of thought
            would affect the experience for each person. For me, I went through
            the experience once and I was content with it <br />
            <strong>7.</strong> It paces the user through cues in the form of
            words and sentences that appear on the screen.<br />
            <strong>8.</strong> When you first load into the webpage, there is a
            tutorial on how to use the different elements that are in the
            experience such as: scrolling on the wheel at the bottom or
            interacting with certain highlighted parts of different scenes that
            are in the image.<br />
            <strong>9.</strong> The other forms of media I noticed in the
            experience were mostly audio elements. Both the sound effects when
            interacting with certain elements as well as the music that was
            playing in certain scenes of the playthough.<br />
            <strong>10.</strong> I think the audio elements of the experience
            encourage the use to put on some headphones to be able to fully
            immerse themself in what the experience has to offer.<br />
            <strong>11.</strong> I think that we should feel a sense of calm and
            a sense of being carefree when interacting with the experience
            because that's how we are supposed to feel when we go on vacation. I
            think that the audi elements of the experience does its best to try
            and emulate that for us as the users.<br />
            <strong>12.</strong> I honestly didn't find anything major to be to
            frustrating with the experience. The only thing that I found a
            little bit frustrating was when I couldn't use the webpage unless I
            had to reduce the size of my browser to actually start and use the
            experience. <br />
            <strong>13.</strong> Most of the experience was honestly very
            satisfying to use. I think I enjoyed the concept of the webpage and
            I found myself to be immersed in the experience because of the art
            and the accompanying backgrouynd music.<br />
